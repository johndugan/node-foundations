npm install <package_name> --save
= install <package_name> and save a reference to it, marking it as a depencency, in the package.json file. the package.json is so great b/c it makes things portable!

npm install <package_name> --save-dev
= install <package_name> and save a reference to it, marking it as a _development_ depencency, in the package.json file.

npm install
= look at the `package.json` file and install all of the "dependencies" and *"devDependencies"

npm update
= look at the `package.json` file and update all of the "dependencies" and *"devDependencies" based on the update rule (~,^, etc)

npm install -g <package_name>
= install <package_name> _globally_. IE: don't install <package_name> in to our projects "node_modules" directory, rather install the package system-wide.

Note, when you deploy an application, most hosting providers that deal with Node will have a way to install your dependencies as part of their process. For this reason, you shouldn't need to deploy anything in your /node_modules directory. Also, it will know that only "dependencies" need to be installed, _not_ "devDependencies" that are only neccessary during the development process.
